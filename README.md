<hr>

AstraFlow is a **dataflow-oriented** reinforcement learning system designed for better flexibility and scalability.

AstraFlow **natively** supports the following for LLM RL training **without any feature-specific system engineering**:

- **Fully Async Multi-policy collaborative RL**
- **Elastic heterogeneous cross-region rollouts**
- **Substitutable rollout and trainer service**
- **Composable data algorithms**

## Roadmap
Near-term focus:

- [ ] **Offline cluster training** — Support training on offline clusters without internet access.
- [ ] **All-in-one launcher** — A launcher helper that streamlines bringing up the AstraFlow, RaaS, and trainer services.
- [ ] **MoE model support** — Extend the training backends to Mixture-of-Experts models.
- [ ] **Terminal-Bench training** — Add a recipe for training agents on Terminal-Bench.
- [ ] **Megatron backend** — Add Megatron-LM as a training backend.
- [ ] **vLLM rollout engine** — Support vLLM alongside SGLang as a rollout engine.
